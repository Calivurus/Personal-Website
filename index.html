        <h3>Cooking:</h3>
        <p>I love cooking; I started in my early twenties. For me, nothing is more enjoyable than creating something from the ground up that I can present to friends and 
          family to brighten up their time. I always strive to present things people would be delighted to order from a restaurant. A personal goal of mine is to 
          eventually be able to cook high-quality cuisine from as many cultures as I can.</p>

        <h3>Literature & Media:</h3>
        <p>I've enjoyed books ever since I was a child reading The Boxcar Children until the early hours of the morning. I've always loved fantasy and Sci-Fi series growing up. 
          In my early twenties, I have also picked up an apprciation for fictional horror. My current favorite series would have to be the Cosmere books from Brandon Sanderson. 
          I first learned of his works from the Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan, which were one of my first adult fantasy series I had ever read. 
          I'm also a fan of the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series by George R. R. Martin. Recently, I have picked up several storytelling podcasts, 
          my favorite two being "We're Alive" by Kc Wayland and "Old Gods of Appalachia" by Cam Collins and Steve Shell.</p>

        <h3>Gaming:</h3>
        <p>I have been into games ever since I was a kid, watching my father play games on our N64. Since then, my tastes have branched out to nearly every game type on the market. 
          I love MMORPGs, with my two favorites being WoW and FFXIV. RPGs, in general, I absolutely adore the Fallout games. 
          The Monster Hunter and Souls games are also phenomenal and currently my most preferred third-person action games. I am also a huge fan of survival crafting games like ARK and Subnautica. </p>
